# 2.3 #

  * Added support for custom friends groups. (<a href='http://code.google.com/p/ljxp/issues/detail?id=37'>#37</a>)
  * Fixed a problem where entries that were edited after being crossposted had the backdate option set, making them disappear from friends lists. This option is now set only when crossposting all entries in bulk. (<a href='http://code.google.com/p/ljxp/issues/detail?id=146'>#146</a>)
  * Fixed another bug in the per-post comments settings. (<a href='http://code.google.com/p/ljxp/issues/detail?id=149'>#149</a>)

# 2.3.1 #
  * Turned off the XML-RPC debug mode, which I accidentally left on in 2.3. (So sorry!)

# 2.3.2 #
  * Fixed yet another bug in the per-post comments settings. (<a href='http://code.google.com/p/ljxp/issues/detail?id=149'>#149</a>)
  * Fixed the relative link function to correctly ignore https URLs. (<a href='http://code.google.com/p/ljxp/issues/detail?id=148'>#148</a>)
