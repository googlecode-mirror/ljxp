If LiveJournal has been down for a few days and you haven't been able to crosspost, you will of course want to catch up when the site comes back up. However, using the "Update options and crosspost all WordPress entries" button is very slow if you have a large site, and it hammers LiveJournal just as it's getting back on its feet.

It would be much nicer to crosspost just the entries LJ missed, and it's easy to do. Go to your Posts screen and check the boxes of the entries that didn't get crossposted. Then, from the Bulk Actions dropdown at the top of the list, choose Edit and press Apply.

Make some small change to the posts -- adding a tag is easiest -- and update them. This will trigger the crossposter only for those posts.

[WordPress.tv has a video showing how Bulk Edit works](http://wordpress.tv/2009/01/14/using-quick-edit-and-bulk-edit-to-manage-your-posts-in-half-the-time/), if you've never used it before.
