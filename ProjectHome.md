The LiveJournal Crossposter (LJXP for short) is a WordPress plugin, which automatically copies new posts to a specified LiveJournal (or DeadJournal or any other LJ-based hosts). Editing and deleting crossposted entries causes the same changes to be made on the LiveJournal.

Compatible with WordPress 3.x.

## Installation ##

  1. Download the latest version from the link on the right
  1. Extract the archive into the wp-content/plugins/ folder. A new folder, lj-xp, should appear
  1. Go to Plugins in the WordPress Dashboard and activate LiveJournal Crossposter
  1. Edit settings under Settings entitled 'LiveJournal' where appropriate

## Under New Management! ##

I've added a slew of new features in the last week and cleaned all the old tickets out of the issue tracker. Please [submit a new ticket](http://code.google.com/p/ljxp/issues/list) if you have any problems at all!

Now that all the major problems have been taken care of, I do _not_ plan to release a new version every few days. Thanks for your patience with all the updates.
